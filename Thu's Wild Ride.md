Arrives at the empty bridge after being pulled in by the blue fog

Empty Bridge is 30 miles north west of crystal dome

He explores a bit and finds the tower with a dead researcher at the top, was researching how to create a permanent domain expansion to seal Sukuna away. Permanent techniques are almost unheard of

Realizes there is no permanent way to domain expand as it is too taxing on the user and energy hungry, so the expansion has to be maintained with an effectively immortal practitioner and a steady source of cursed energy. A deal with a cursed spirit?, A deal with a god?, Maybe, but if they're willing to fund the domain by that same mechanism they can stop funding it. Semi-Permanent? By collecting energy every once in a while and "depositing", oh right collecting cursed energy is another rabbit hole I'll investigate. 

After a couple rounds a portal opens that leads back to reality and hears a faint message from Komana sealing away his memories 

What Thu knows:

too taxing on the user and energy hungry, "A deal with a god?" "A deal with"

"fund the domain " "they can stop funding it."

"Semi-Permanent?"

"Collecting cursed energy, I'll investigate"
