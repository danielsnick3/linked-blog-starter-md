| A trail of vines continuously follows each enemy in this combat, if an enemy touches any vines they must succeed on a dc 17 strength saving throw or have the grasping vines attached to them. While the vines are attached the creature loses half of their movement and gains a stack of Putrescence when they fail a saving throw. At the beginning of an attached creatures turn the saving throw is rolled again on a success breaking free. Moving 30ft. in one round or using an action may remove the vines. |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
