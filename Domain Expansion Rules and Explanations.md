A domain expansion is the ultimate cursed technique that allows one to impose their will on an area. This manifests in a guaranteed hit, like in the o-zone where a debuff always landed with no saving throw. When I say hit it does not have to be damage, zone of truth is an example of domain expansion generalized for ease of use with its guaranteed effect being telling the truth.

A domain expansions has 3 parts to it
1. The environment 
2. The barrier
3. The technique 

Without all 3 parts a domain expansion is incomplete and will not have its guaranteed hit property, but can still apply buffs to the domain user. As an example, Famines' domain was incomplete until constrictor started entering causing the rough terrain. As soon as Constrictor would act his domain technique would have been fully realized.

  
There are 3 types of domains

Simple domain: the most basic of domain expansions whose primary use is to counter other domains. You strip back most of the usual properties of domains to the bare minimum: incorporate natural environment, erect a small barrier within 5ft of yourself, imbued with an extremely basic technique (move if something enters range). By limiting these factors you can focus all your energy on protecting from the effects of enemy domains.


Non-Lethal domain: The effects of this type of domain vary wildly as they inherently do not deal damage. O-zone is an example as well as zone of truth.


Lethal domain: Lethal domains inherently deal damage or kill enemies. The only type of domain that allows one to escape another domain from the inside.


Refractory period: Even if the domain expansion is interrupted, during casting, these effects still apply. You gain one level of exhaustion. **Note**: exhaustion is the 2024 rules where each level is -2 to all ability scores and -5 to speed per level.
