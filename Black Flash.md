# Activation

If a creature rolls a nat 20 on an attack or a creature rolls a nat 1 on a saving throw. a second d20 is rolled. If the second roll is a 20 a black flash occurs. Other factors can increase or lower the threshold of when a black flash occurs but generally the longer a fight goes the easier it is to black flash.
