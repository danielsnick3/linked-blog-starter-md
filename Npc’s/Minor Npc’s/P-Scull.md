Captain hitsugaya (Bleach)

Summons ice sculptures whose activation can be delayed until after they have melted to be reconstructed to their initial summoned state. 

In combat this translates to there being a lot of ice sculptures summoned at once only moving once activated. If an activated sculpture is destroyed it crumbles and loses its cursed energy. If an inactive sculpture is destroyed it is reconstructed to its summoned state and is immediately activated. Must be surgical in the destructions or risk being overrun. If too many are destroyed domain expansion activates that causes sculptures to form on P-Scull’s body and attack guaranteed independently as they move.
