Nova hires the party to capture someone with a creation cursed technique as they are quite rare. Goal is to enslave them to advance gun tech. Currently captured and being used to make chains by a cult trying to make a perfect sphere.

Food has not been too plentiful in the area for a while, but it was enough to keep an equilibrium. Now that famine is around prices have risen sharply. Word gets around and people panic buy and a lot of the food they buy goes bad causing them to buy again and create a death spiral for food. Converting materials to food isn’t too bad, but creating from nothing is difficult.

Initial lead is where food has gone missing. The cursed technique requires a lot of energy to use so they need to constantly be fed to continue making things. With famine around food is becoming scarcer so look for bulk orders of food.

Been a slave ever since parents died and couldn’t protect them anymore

Construction: Technique works by knowing intimately the properties, proportions, and chemical makeup of an object even if it has never been made before they can make it. Takes a lot of cursed energy to make even small things. Extremely useful due to it not requiring the collection or preparation of materials beforehand.

Lots of gun designs strewn about novas office

Nova is not too powerful of a cursed spirit since guns aren’t a very widespread fear.

Posting: seeking help acquiring materials for manufacturing guns

Somehow relates back to blor??? Domain expansion stuff maybe, how cursed spirits spread fear in indirect ways more guns and more powerful guns means more fear of guns

Reward: x gold and a special gun
