Nova hires the party to capture someone with a creation cursed technique as they are quite rare. Goal is to enslave them to advance gun tech. Currently captured and being used to make chains

Been a slave ever since parents died and couldn’t protect them anymore

Technique works by knowing intimately the properties, proportions, and chemical makeup of an object even if it has never been made before they can make it

Lots of gun designs strewn about novas office

Posting: seeking help acquiring materials for manufacturing guns

Somehow relates back to blor??? Domain expansion stuff maybe, how cursed spirits spread fear in indirect ways more guns and more powerful guns means more fear of guns

Reward: x gold and a special gun
