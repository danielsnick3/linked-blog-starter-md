Amnesiac Caspian (josuke): has no memories figure out who he is, has 4 balls 

Posting: I have amnesia and know very little about myself, my body is weird, ( I have 4 balls) and I woke up wearing a sailor outfit. ( probably swap the sailor outfit to something else goblin?) Please assist.

Vodka Is a student of nagoblin who went missing and combined with Caspian who is a forest dweller that is friendly with the chimeras, is also a two soul in sync thanks to hanami

Both were animal lovers and wanted to stop hanami due to them experimenting on animals


Hanami’s domain expansion lets them combine things equally especially those with souls, can combine themself with any plants for instance 

Doesn’t initially remember where he woke up but after fighting some two soul minosnakes or something like that he remembers and leads them to hanami’s lair

Reward: cool magic belt and a new friend
